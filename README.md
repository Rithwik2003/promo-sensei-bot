🧠 Key Design Decisions (RAG + LLM Integration)


🔍 Why Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Rather than letting an LLM guess answers from scratch, RAG ensures responses are grounded in real, up-to-date offer data scraped from Nykaa, Puma, Flipkart, and Ajio. This allows Promo Sensei to answer questions like:

"Are there any shoes under ₹1000 with 40% off?"

...based only on verifiable scraped results, not guesses.


⚙️ How RAG Works in Promo Sensei

Scraped Offers (via scraper.py) are saved in offers.json

Offers are embedded into vectors using sentence-transformers (MiniLM) in ingest_to_vector_db.py

User queries are embedded and compared against offer vectors using FAISS (semantic search)

Top-k offers are retrieved and passed as context to the LLM

LLM generates the final response with instructions like:
"Only answer based on these deals, be helpful and precise."


🤖 Why OpenRouter + GPT-3.5

OpenRouter lets us access models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 reliably and affordably

Avoids rate limits or credit issues tied to OpenAI keys

Easy plug-and-play with our existing rag_query.py using OpenAI-compatible APIlaywright handles scrolling, lazy loading, and dynamic JavaScript better than requests/BeautifulSoup — which is crucial for sites like Ajio, Puma, and Nykaa.
